I prepared a portfolio website introducing myself as Yash Vats. At the top, it displays the name along with a navigation menu that links to different sections of the page such as Home, About, and Contact. The Home section welcomes and gives a short introduction, while the About section includes a personal description along with an image. The Projects section highlights some of the key works, such as a school management system, a form project, and a styled web page. Technical skills are presented in a table format, showing knowledge of Python, HTML, and CSS. Finally, the Contact section provides a form where viewers can enter their name, email, and message to reach out directly.
